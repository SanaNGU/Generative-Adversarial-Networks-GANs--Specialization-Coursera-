# Course 1 :Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
## Week 1
#### In the first week of the first course you will be Learn :
- What is GAN and where we can use it?
 GANs allow you to build models that can generate realistic images or music and other things,GANs comprises of two models thatcompete with each other and reach a point where realistic examples are produced by the generator.
- What are the two models behind GANs?
Generator and discriminator (both are neural networks)
- GAN application; see some not- -existent people who generate by GAN!!!
